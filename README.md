# Registration form using basic PHP and MySQL - First project.
This is my first PHP project that I built using PHP, HTML, and SQL. <br>
The tools I used are XAMPP and VSCode. <br>
The idea behind my project is that I created a simple registration form to store usernames and passwords.<br>
Additionally, I made a couple of empty pages to use as a reference for sessions.<br>

Here are the steps to deploy this project:
<pre>
1. Install XAMPP version 3.3.0.
2. During installation, select only the necessary modules, with the exception of PHP, choose mySQL as the additional module.
3. Clone this project to the "C:\xampp\htdocs\website" folder.
4. Launch XAMPP and in the "Actions" section, click on "START" for both the APACHE and MYSQL modules.
5. The default ports for MYSQL are 3306.
6. Click the "ADMIN" button in the MYSQL module's actions.
7. Import the "businessdb.sql" file (included in the project files).
8. Open your browser and navigate to "localhost/website."
9. The index page should appear.
10.Try registering and then check the "businessdb.sql" file to verify if it has been updated.

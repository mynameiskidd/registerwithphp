# Registration form using basic PHP and MySQL - First project.
This is my first PHP project that I built using PHP, HTML, and SQL. <br>
The tools I used are XAMPP and VSCode. <br>
The idea behind my project is that I created a simple registration form to store usernames and passwords.<br>
Additionally, I made a couple of empty pages to use as a reference for sessions.<br>
